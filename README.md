# üöÄ Airbnb London Analytics with dbt, Snowflake, AWS S3, and GitHub Actions

## üìå Prerequisites
- **dbt Core** installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/installation))
- **VS Code & dbt Power User Extension**
- **Snowflake** account and credentials
- **AWS S3 bucket (for storing datasets)**
- **Git & GitHub (for version control and CI/CD)**
- **Looker Studio (for dashboarding)**

## üì• Dataset
We use the **[Airbnb London dataset](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)**, which contains listings, reviews, and calendar availability data.

### Preparing the Data:
1. Download the dataset (CSV format) from the link above.(PS: I have take the zip csv files to get more columns)
2. Store the files (`listings.csv`, `calendar.csv`, `reviews.csv`) in an AWS S3 bucket.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake Setup
### üõ†Ô∏è Create an S3 Bucket and Upload CSV Files
Refer to AWS documentation for configuring S3 and integrating with Snowflake.

### üîó Setting up AWS Integration:
```sql
USE WAREHOUSE AIRBNB_WH;

CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION s3_int
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3
  ENABLED = TRUE
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = '<YOUR_AWS_ROLE>'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://your-bucket/your-folder/');
```

### üèóÔ∏è Setting Up Data in Snowflake:
```sql
USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
USE DATABASE AIRBNB;
USE SCHEMA RAW;

### **Install dbt Dependencies**
```sh
dbt deps
```

### **Run dbt Models**
```sh
dbt run
```
To run a specific model:
```sh
dbt run --select fact_bookings
```

### **Test and Document Models**
```sh
dbt test
dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve
```

## üìä Model Descriptions

### **1. Staging Layer**

stg_listings.sql - Cleans and standardizes listings data, handling missing values and normalizing column formats.

stg_calendar.sql - Processes daily availability and pricing data, filtering out inconsistencies.

stg_reviews.sql - Prepares reviews data, extracting relevant metadata for further transformation.

schema.yml - Defines relationships, constraints, and metadata for the staging models.

### **2. Marts Layer**
#### **Dimensions**

dim_hosts.sql - Aggregates host details, including number of listings and ratings.

dim_listings.sql - Stores detailed Airbnb listings data, including property type, room type, location, and host info.

dim_reviews.sql - Structures review data for analysis, including review frequency and sentiment trends.

schema.yml - Defines structure, constraints, and documentation for dimension tables.

#### **Facts**

fact_bookings.sql - (Incremental model) Stores confirmed bookings, linking listings and availability data.

fact_pricing_trends.sql - Tracks pricing variations over time, identifying seasonal pricing trends.

fact_availability_trends.sql - Analyzes occupancy rates, showing which properties are booked most frequently.

fact_listings_performance.sql - Computes key listing performance metrics, including revenue, booking rate, and review count.

schema.yml - Defines structure, constraints, and business logic for fact tables.

### **3. Final Aggregated Model**
final_airbnb_listings.sql - Combines listings, bookings, pricing, and reviews for comprehensive reporting.

schema.yml - Metadata and constraints for the final aggregated model.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

dbt_project.yml - Defines dbt project settings, model configurations, and default behaviors.

sources.yml - Configures data sources (AWS S3 ‚Üí Snowflake), defining schemas and table sources.

exposure_dashboard.yml - Tracks dbt model usage in reporting tools like Looker Studio.

packages.yml - Manages dbt dependencies and external packages.



## üöÄ Running Tests and Models
- Run all models:
  ```sh
  dbt run
  ```
- Run tests to validate transformations:
  ```sh
  dbt test
  ```
- Run a specific model:
  ```sh
  dbt run --select <model-name>
  ```
- Run incremental models:
  ```sh
  dbt run --full-refresh
  ```

## üîÑ Setting Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
To automate `dbt run` and `dbt test` on every commit:
1. Create `.github/workflows/dbt-ci.yml` with:
```yaml
   name: "DBT CI/CD Pipeline"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual execution

jobs:
  dbt-ci-cd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install DBT & Snowflake Adapter
        run: |
          pip install dbt-core dbt-snowflake

      - name: Configure DBT Profiles
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.dbt
          echo "${{ secrets.DBT_PROFILES }}" > ~/.dbt/profiles.yml

      - name: Install DBT Dependencies
        run: dbt deps

      - name: Run DBT Tests
        run: dbt test  # Runs data quality tests

      - name: Run DBT Models
        run: dbt run --exclude tag:skip_ci  # Runs models except those tagged as skip_ci

      - name: Check DBT Model Performance
        run: |
          cat target/run_results.json | jq '.results[] | {model: .unique_id, time: .execution_time}'

```

2. **Secure your credentials**: Store sensitive values (like Snowflake credentials) in **GitHub Secrets** instead of hardcoding them.
3. Commit and push the workflow file to trigger automated runs.


## üîó Integrations
### **1. Looker Studio Dashboard**
- Connected Snowflake to Looker Studio for real-time analytics.
- Includes KPI scorecards, sales trends, and customer segmentation.
- For exposure_dashboard replace the link with your report link 
## üìà Key Findings
- **Data Cleansing & Transformation**: Ensures accurate and standardized datasets.
- **Optimized Queries**: Snowflake‚Äôs clustering and indexing improve performance.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment of dbt models.
- **Incremental Models**: Ensures faster updates by processing only new data.
